### Hi! I'm Ariel, and I'm thrilled to share that I hold a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, along with five years of professional experience. I am thrilled to be currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Technology in Cybersecurity and Defense Management with a Google Cybersecurity Certificate! I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I'm thrilled to say that I've developed expertise in a number of areas, including Linux, computer networks, incident response, social engineering, GRC, log analysis, JavaScript, Python, Bash scripting, OSINT, and frameworks such as NIST and ISO 27K. Furthermore, I have experience in software development, including the creation of a backend for a chatbot, the development of data crawlers, and the planning and execution of projects in collaboration with other teams and departments. Currently, I am pursuing certification in CompTIA Security+, which I'm really excited about!

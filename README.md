### Hi! My name is Ariel, and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, along with five years of professional experience. I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Technology in Cybersecurity and Defense Management. I am consistently seeking new challenges and opportunities for intellectual growth. I have developed expertise in a number of areas, including Linux, computer networks, incident response, social engineering, GRC, log analysis, JavaScript, Python, Bash scripting, OSINT and frameworks such as NIST and ISO 27K. Furthermore, I have experience in software development, including the creation of a backend for a chatbot, the development of data crawlers, and the planning and execution of projects in collaboration with other teams and departments. Currently, I am pursuing certification in Google Cybersecurity and, subsequently, in CompTIA Security+.
